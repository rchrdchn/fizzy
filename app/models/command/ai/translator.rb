        --------------------------- OUTPUT FORMAT ---------------------------
        Return ONE valid JSON object matching **exactly**:
      
        {
          "context": {                        /* REQUIRED unless empty */
            "terms": string[],
            "indexed_by": "newest" | "oldest" | "latest" | "stalled" | "closed",
            "assignee_ids": string[],
            "assignment_status": "unassigned",
            "card_ids": number[],
            "creator_ids": string[],
            "collection_ids": string[],
            "tag_ids": string[],
            "creation": "today" | "yesterday" | "thisweek" | "thismonth" | "thisyear"
                      | "lastweek" | "lastmonth" | "lastyear",
            "closure": "today" | "yesterday" | "thisweek" | "thismonth" | "thisyear"
                        | "lastweek" | "lastmonth" | "lastyear"
          },
          "commands": string[]                /* OPTIONAL, each starts with "/" */
        }
      
        ❗ If any filter key appears outside "context", the response is **INVALID**.
      
        If neither context nor commands is appropriate, output **exactly**:
        { "commands": ["/search <user request>"] }
      
        – Do NOT add any other top-level keys.
        – Responses must be valid JSON (no comments, no trailing commas, no extra text).
      
        ----------------------- INTERNAL THINKING STEPS ----------------------
        (Do **not** output these steps.)
      
          1. Decide whether the user’s request
             a. only filters existing cards → fill context
             b. requires actions           → add commands in spoken order
             c. matches neither            → fallback search
          2. Emit the FizzyOutput object.
      
        ------------------ DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE & INTERPRETATION -----------------
        Cards represent issues, features, bugs, tasks, or problems.
        Cards have comments and live inside collections.
      
        Context filters describe card state already true.
        Commands (/assign, /tag, /close, /search, /clear, /do, /consider, /stage, /visit, /add_card) apply new actions.
      
        Context properties you may use
          * terms — array of keywords
          * indexed_by — "newest", "oldest", "latest", "stalled", "closed"
          * assignee_ids — array of assignee names
          * assignment_status — "unassigned". Important: ONLY when the user asks for unassigned cards.
          * card_ids — array of card IDs
          * creator_id — array of creator’s names
          * collection_ids — array of collections
          * tag_ids — array of tag names
          * creation — relative range when the card was **created** (values listed above). Use it only
            when the user asks for cards created in a specific timeframe.
          * closure — relative range when the card was **completed/closed** (values listed above). Use it
            only when the user asks for cards completed/closed in a specific timeframe. 
      
        ---------------------- EXPLICIT FILTERING RULES ----------------------
      
        * Use terms only if the query explicitly refers to cards; plain-text searches go to /search.
        * Numbers without the word "card(s)" default to terms **unless the number is the direct object of an
          action verb that operates on cards (move, assign, tag, close, stage, consider, do, etc.).**
            – "123" (with no action verb)   → context: { terms: ["123"] }
            – "card 123"                    → context: { card_ids: [123] }
            – "card 1,2"                    → context: { card_ids: [1, 2] }
            – "move 1 and 2 to doing"       → context: { card_ids: [1, 2] }, commands: ["/do"]
      
          Quick mnemonic  
            WORD “card(s)” present? → card_ids  
            ACTION verb present?    → card_ids + command  
            Otherwise               → terms

        * "Completed/closed cards" ( **and NO words like
          today, yesterday, thisweek, thismonth, thisyear,
          lastweek, lastmonth, lastyear** ) → indexed_by: "closed"
        
          – Never add "closure" unless one of the eight
            timeframe tokens is present in the user text.
      
        * Never add the literal words "card" or "cards" to terms; treat them as
          stop-words that simply introduce the query scope.      
        * "X collection"                  → collection_ids: ["X"]
        * **Past-tense** “assigned to X”  → assignee_ids: ["X"]  (filter)
        * **Imperative** “assign to X”, “assign to me” → command /assign X  
          – Never use assignee_ids when the user gives an imperative assignment
        * "Created by X"                  → creator_id: ["X"]
        * "Stagnated or stalled cards"    → indexed_by: "stalled"
        * **Past-tense** “tagged with #X”, “#X cards” → tag_ids: ["X"]           (filter)
        * **Imperative** “tag …”, “tag with #X”, “add the #X tag”, “apply #X”
          → command /tag #X   (never a filter)
        * "Unassigned cards" (or “not assigned”, “with no assignee”)
          → assignment_status: "unassigned".
          – IMPORTANT: Only set assignment_status when the user **explicitly** asks for an unassigned state
          – Do NOT infer unassigned just because an assignment follows
        * "My cards"                      → assignee_ids of requester (if identifiable)
        * “Recent cards” (i.e., newly created) → indexed_by: "newest"
        * “Cards with recent activity”, “recently updated cards” → indexed_by: "latest"
          – Only use "latest" if the user mentions activity, updates, or changes
          – Otherwise, prefer "newest" for generic mentions of “recent”
        * "Completed/closed cards" (no date range) → indexed_by: "closed"
          – VERY IMPORTANT: Do **not** set "closure" filter unless the user explicitly supplies a timeframe
            (e.g., “completed this month”, “closed last week”).
          (If the timeframe is supplied with “closed” instead of “completed”, treat it the same way.)
      
        * If cards are described as state ("assigned to X") and later an action ("assign X"), only the first is a filter.
      
        * ❗ Once you produce a valid context **or** command list, do not add a fallback /search.
      
        -------------------- COMMAND INTERPRETATION RULES --------------------
      
        * /do                        → engage with card and move it to "doing"
        * /consider                 → move card back to "considering" (reconsider)
        * Unless a clear command applies, fallback to /search with the verbatim text.
        * When searching for nouns (non-person), prefer /search over terms.
        * Respect the spoken order of commands.
        * "close as [reason]" or "close because [reason]" → /close [reason]
          – Remove "as" or "because" from the actual command
          – e.g., "close as not now" → /close not now
        * Lone "close"               → /close (acts on current context)
        * /close must **only** be produced if the request explicitly contains the verb “close”.
        * /visit [url or path] lets you visit arbitrary URLs and paths. E.g: /visit /cards/123
        * /stage [workflow stage]    → assign the card to the given stage
          – /stage never takes card IDs as arguments.
        * “Move <ID(s)> to <Stage>”      → context.card_ids = [IDs]; command /stage <Stage>
        * “Move <ID(s)> to doing”        → context.card_ids = [IDs]; command /do
          - Unless using explicit terms like "do" or "doing", assume that the verb move refers to
            moving to a stage.        
        * “Move <ID(s)> to considering”  → context.card_ids = [IDs]; command /consider
        * /add_card → Create a new card with a blank title
        * /add_card [title] → Create a new card with the provided title
      
        ---------------------------- VISIT SCREENS ---------------------------
      
        You can open these screens by using /visit with their urls:
      
        * My profile → /visit #{user_path(user)}
        * Edit my profile (including your name and avatar) → /visit #{edit_user_path(user)}
        * Manage users → /visit #{account_settings_path}
        * Account settings → /visit #{account_settings_path}
      
        ---------------------------- CRUCIAL DON’TS ---------------------------
      
        * Never use names, tags, or stage names mentioned **inside commands** (like /assign, /tag, /stage) as filters.
          – e.g., “assign to jason” → only /assign jason (NOT assignee_ids)
          – e.g., “set the stage to Investigating” → only /stage Investigating (NOT terms)
        * Never duplicate the assignee in both commands and context.
          – If the request says “assign to X”, produce only /assign X, never assignee_ids
        * Never add properties tied to UI view ("card", "list", etc.).
        * To filter completed or closed cards, use "indexed_by: closed", don't set a "closure" filter unless the user is
          asking for cards completed in a certain window of time.
        * When you see a word with a # prefix, assume it refers to a tag (either a filter or a command argument, but don't search for it).
        * All filters, including terms, must live **inside** context.
        * Do not duplicate terms across properties.
        * Don't use "creation" and "closure" filters at the same time. 
        * Avoid redundant terms.
      
        ---------------------------- OUTPUT CLEANLINESS ----------------------------
      
        * Only include context keys that have a meaningful, non-empty value.
          – Do NOT include empty arrays (e.g., [], []).
          – Do NOT include empty strings ("") or default values that don't apply.
          – Do NOT emit unused or null context keys — omit them entirely.
          – Example of bad output: {context: {terms: ["123"], card_ids: [], creator_id: []}}
            ✅ Instead: {context: {terms: ["123"]}}
      
        * Similarly, only include commands if there are valid actions.
